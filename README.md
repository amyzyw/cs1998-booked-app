# PROJECT IDEA
 
Our BOOKED - “Book a Study Space” app will enable the user to book a study space on campus in one of Cornell’s many open libraries and study spaces. The current website’s pain points are that it requires many links to navigate to the booking site, and the process for doing so is unintuitive. Our app will 
1) Allow the user to see/ search for open study spaces 
2) Allow the user to reserve, keep track of the spaces they have reserved, including the times for which they have it booked, and delete their reservation

# APP FLOW

Important Note: We are currently supporting booking in ONE day! We will learn to implement calendar/ date management for booking in the future later!

- Initially, the homepage lists all libraries (including the image, opening/ closing time on each card of the library)
- In the header of the homepage, there are buttons (Arts/ Ag/ Eng Quad) for the user to choose → Homepage will filter and list only the libraries in a specific quad if the user chooses any button
- When the user chooses a library, we will provide them a list of available rooms in that library (including name and capacity)
- When the user chooses a room, we will provide a list of available timeslots for booking with a reservation button next to each timeslot
- When a user clicks reserve, a booking will automatically be created and stored
- If the user clicks “Reservation” tab at the bottom, a list of their reservations will appear, and they can choose to delete reservations for each timeslot shown.
